Rails Blog
Live Demo: https://blog-app-greyknight.fly.dev
A fully functional, production-ready blogging platform built with Ruby on Rails. Users can seamlessly create, edit, and delete posts while exploring clean Rails architecture, RESTful routing, and robust CRUD operations.
Why It Stands Out:
Demonstrates practical Rails development with scalable, maintainable code
Designed for rapid feature expansion: authentication, commenting, notifications
Highlights ability to turn ideas into real-world, usable applications
Tech Stack: Ruby | Rails | SQLite/PostgreSQL | HTML | CSS
